# Car Doctor
# Back-End Server of Car Doctor
# Developed by Ariyan Rahman Anas


## Overview
Welcome to the Car Doctor backend repository! This repository contains the server-side codebase responsible for managing data storage, handling API requests, and implementing business logic for the Car Doctor project.

## Key Features:

### 1. Database Management with MongoDB
- Utilizes MongoDB as the primary database for storing and managing various data entities such as users, services, products, reviews, and blog posts.
- Leverages MongoDB's document-oriented data model for flexibility and scalability in handling complex data structures.

### 2. Express.js Server
- Employs Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, to handle HTTP requests and define API endpoints.
- Implements robust routing, middleware, and error handling to ensure smooth communication between the frontend and the database.

### 3. RESTful API Endpoints
- Defines RESTful API endpoints to facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing resources such as users, services, products, reviews, and blog posts.
- Ensures proper validation and authentication mechanisms to maintain data integrity and security.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- Implements user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely manage user sessions and access control.
- Enforces authorization rules to restrict access to certain endpoints or resources based on user roles and permissions.


## Technologies Used:
- MongoDB
- Express.js
